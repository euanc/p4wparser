# p4wparser
Basic python parsing syntax for parsing project for web tasks json

Project for web doesn't currently seem to have any easy data export options. This script helps with that. 

If you select all tasks in a Project for Web project and right click and select "copy task", you can paste that into a text file and save as json. 
That json can be the input for this small python script that shows how you can start to parse it out. This program prints a list of task names.

Usage:

```python
python p4wparser.py tasks.json
```
